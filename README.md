Pixel Flowers was originally designed to be the framework for a series of NFTs inspired by the likes of CryptoPunks and CryptoKitties. The original plans were abandoned, but the art was finished, and I liked it so much I wanted it to live on as art project.

Each Pixel Flower consists of a series of parts that layer together to form the complete flowers. There are:

22 different petal styles
16 stems
13 pistils
and 15 pots
When you consider each part can be any color, there are almost endless combinations. You can get an idea of what this looks like by visiting the [endless garden], where you can keep scrolling to endlessly generate Pixel Flowers.

The Pixel Flowers website also features a Designer that lets you create your own flowers and share them with your friends.
